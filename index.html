    <h1>The Blazing Firefox Logos</h1>
    <img src="images/firefox-icon.png"
    alt="A fiery fox enfolding the earth - representing the Firefox logo">
    <p>The firefox logo depicts a bright blazing fox with a fiery tail of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>red</li>
      <li>orange</li>
      <li>yellow</li>
    </ul>
    <p> flames igniting through its body. The glowing fox envelops around
      the bottom of our beautiful blue earth in a brilliant flaming
      design. If you look closely, you can see several shapes outlining
      along the earth that possibly represent the continents that we
      reside on and comprise our earth. Looking at the fox's features
      starting from bottom of the body to the top you can see that it has a:
      <ol>
        <li>sharp layered tail at the bottom</li>
        <li>a curved body along the middle</li>
        <li>an outreaching paw towards the top</li>
        <li>an upright head at the top</li>
      </ol></p>
    <p>All of this encompasses the Firefox logo that we see before us.
