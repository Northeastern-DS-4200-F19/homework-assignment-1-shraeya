    <h1>The Blazing Firefox Logos</h1>
    <img src="images/firefox-icon.png"
    alt="A fiery fox enfolding the earth - representing the Firefox logo">
    <p>The firefox logo depicts a bright blazing fox with a fiery tail of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>red</li>
      <li>orange</li>
      <li>yellow</li>
    </ul>
    <p> flames igniting through its body. The glowing fox envelops around
      <br>the bottom of our beautiful blue earth in a brilliant flaming design.
      <br>If you look closely, you can see several shapes outlining along the
      <br>earth that possibly represent the continents that we reside on and
      <br>encompass our earth. </p>
    <img src="images/firefox2.png"
    alt="A white fox in an orange hexagon - representing another Firefox logo">
    <p>Another firefox logo that instead depicts a white silhouette of a fox
      <br>with a fiery tail, as it resides upon an orange three-dimensional
      <br>hexagon. This fox may be less detailed than our first logo, but it
      <br>appears to have very similar features, such as:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>the sharp layered tail at the bottom of the fox</li>
        <li>curved body along the middle</li>
        <li>the outreaching paw</li>
        <li>the similarly structured upright paw</li>
      </ol>
      <p>However, this fox is portrayed instead as a silhouette on an orange
      <br>hexagon, rather than our blue earth.
